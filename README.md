# Area Estimation System (AES)

## Overview

The **Area Estimation System (AES)** is an innovative project aimed at accurately estimating land areas using satellite imagery. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning, AES transforms annotated satellite images into valuable data, enabling effective land management and analysis.

## Features

- **Automated Area Measurement**: Quickly and accurately estimate land areas from satellite images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy interaction and visualization of results.
- **Customizable Models**: Tailor the model to specific types of land and varying satellite images.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilize state-of-the-art algorithms to enhance measurement precision.

## Installation

To set up the Area Estimation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FaizaBenzir/aes.git
   cd aes
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables and configurations as needed.

## Usage

To run the Area Estimation System, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_satellite_image> --output <output_file>
```

### Example

```bash
python main.py --input satellite_image.jpg --output area_estimation.txt
```
